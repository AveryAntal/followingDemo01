    <p>
        I am a beginner with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        I have taken the Intro to Web Design (HTML and CSS,) and the Computational Thinking class (JavaScript.)
        For both of these classes I used Visual Studio Code. 
        I look forward to this class to gain a more advanced understanding.
    </p>  

    <p>Over my summer internship, the developers in the company talked about GitHub frequently. 
        In this class, I want to become more familiar with using GitHub since it may be valuable to at least understadn in career position sin the future. 
        In this class I also look forward to becoming more confident in my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills/knowledge.
